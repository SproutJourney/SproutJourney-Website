## üé• Pitch Video

We‚Äôve created a **2-minute pitch video** that showcases our product through animated storytelling, real interface demonstration, and a deep dive into the technical and emotional design of SproutJourney.

> üéôÔ∏è *Note: The voiceover uses AI-generated audio (via ElevenLabs)* as part of our product testing. We believe voice is key to immersion, accessibility, and retention for early learners, especially those with reading difficulties.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Gen-AI & Agent Intelligence
- **Gemma 2.5B** (fine-tuned locally with LoRA)
- Also experimenting with **LLaMA 3.1 8B** and **Flan-T5**
- **Multi-agent LLM system** with subject-specialist agents (e.g., Eli the Elephant for Social Science)
- **Custom RAG pipeline** with concept-specific retrieval nodes per agent
- **Language Graphs** to structure grade-wise content with Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy, cognitive depth, and cultural context
- Built-in **guardrails** for hallucination prevention and child-safe response control

### Orchestration & Voice Interaction
- **LangChain + LangGraph** for multi-agent logic and decision flow
- **ChromaDB** (testing) with plans to shift to **scalable vector DB**
- **TTS & Voice AI** using **ElevenLabs** and **Azure AI Voice** (in progress)
- **Speech-based narration + gamified character interaction** with custom voice embedding for each domain agent

### Front-End & Deployment
- Built in **Unity Engine** for immersive storytelling and interaction
- Gamified quizzes, moral dilemmas, and learning simulations
- Hosted via **Hyperstack GPU platform** + Python Flask backend

### Experimental Extensions
- Integration of **Stable Diffusion** and **video generation models** for dynamic visual feedback
- Ongoing adaptation for multilingual support and edge-deployment in low-connectivity schools
