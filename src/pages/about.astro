      <span class="lg:text-2xl text-xl lg:w-[70%] w-[90%]">
        We are a passionate team of educators, technologists, and innovators
        committed to reshaping how children learn. Our goal is simpleâ€”solve the
        problem of disengaged, one-size-fits-all education by making learning
        more interactive, adaptive, and exciting. SproutJourney was born out of
        a deep desire to help children develop critical life skills through fun,
        story-driven learning. We're driven by a shared vision: to create a
        platform where learning becomes an enjoyable, personalized experience
        for every child.

          is to revolutionize education by using AI to create individualized,

          by providing tools like Eli the Elephant, we can spark curiosity,
